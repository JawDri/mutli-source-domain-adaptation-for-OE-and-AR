DCTN Method

In MSDA.ipynb file run the cell for the specific task that you want to test (OE or AR, balanced or unbalanced). for AR, the number of instances selected for balanced and unbalanced datasets are written in the comments.

To create several pre-trained models from multiple source, run: MSDA.ipynb cells

Change the number of classes and input feature dimensions inside the code to fit the considered task.

TO TRAIN AND TEST MSDA: !python train_eval.py
